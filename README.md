#FaceReaderAPI bindings for Python

In order to utilize these bindings, the python environment will need:

-Python 2.7.x 32-bit Environment (required for Python for .NET)

-Python for .NET installed, which entails adding the Python for .NET
----files "clr.pyd" and "Python.Runtime.dll" to the Python directory (e.g. C:\Python27\).
----Can be downloaded from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonnet/files/
----Home of Python for .NET is http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/ with some documentation.

-Add the file "FaceReaderAPI.dll" to the Python "DLL" folder (e.g. C:\Python27\DLL)


The file Test.py is being used to test implementation of the FaceReaderBindCPython.py module (I hope to get that name down in size. Feel free to suggest some catchy names.)

I'm making the python file for python integration use in experimental research software such as OpenSesame and PsychoPy, not for use in standalone applications, but if you can think of a good use for this let me know and I'll whip something up.
