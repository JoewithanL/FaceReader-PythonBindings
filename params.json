{"name":"Facereader-pythonbindings","tagline":"Binding Noldus FaceReaderAPI.dll to python language","body":"In order to utilize these bindings, the python environment will need:\r\n\r\n-Python 2.7.x 32-bit Environment (required for Python for .NET)\r\n\r\n-Python for .NET installed, which entails adding the Python for .NET files \"clr.pyd\" and \"Python.Runtime.dll\" to the Python directory (e.g. C:\\Python27).  \r\nCan be downloaded from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonnet/files/.  \r\nHome of Python for .NET is http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/ with some documentation.\r\n\r\n-Add the file \"FaceReaderAPI.dll\" to the Python \"DLL\" folder (e.g. C:\\Python27\\DLL)\r\n\r\nThe file Test.py is being used to test implementation of the FaceReaderBindCPython.py module (I hope to get that name down in size. Feel free to suggest some catchy names.)\r\n\r\nI'm making the python file for python integration use in experimental research software such as OpenSesame and PsychoPy, not for use in standalone applications, but if you can think of a good use for this let me know and I'll whip something up.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
